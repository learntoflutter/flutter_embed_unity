# Example Unity project

Use this Unity project as an example of how to send and receive message from Flutter, or to build [the example Flutter app](https://github.com/jamesncl/flutter_embed_unity/tree/main/flutter_embed_unity/example).

It is also used to develop the `flutter_embed_unity_2022_3.unitypackage`, including the build scripts which make it easier to integrate the Unity project export into your Flutter app. As an alternative to importing `flutter_embed_unity_2022_3.unitypackage` you could copy the script assets from this project.
